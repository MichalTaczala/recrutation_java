# Requirements:
- Tests are not be working - find out whatâ€™s wrong and fix the source code accordingly

Files Receipt.java, ReceiptGenerator.java, TenPercentDiscount.java has been changed, so now the tests doesn't fail.

- Our product owner needs a new type of promotion - a 15% discount on the total price,
which should be applied only if at least 3-grain products are in the basket. It applies before
the 10% discount that is implemented

New file is created: FifteenPercentDiscount.java which works similarily to TenPercentDiscount.java.

- Using framework of your choice (e.g. Spring Boot) implement a Rest endpoint, that will
accept the Basket object and return the Receipt with the calculated price

Spring boot controller and service are created for Receipt.

- Remember about tests for the implemented use cases

For every written classes and functions, there are unit tests written.
